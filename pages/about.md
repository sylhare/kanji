## Kanji Radicals
_Japanese radicals presented as learning cards._

The Japanese written system comes from the chinese one. So the japanese radicals or _"bushu"_ comes from the chinese Kangxi radical.
With the years it has evolve a bit differently but they remain very similar.

It gets a bit complicated because not all radicals are recognized by the ministry of education in japan (Or at least I have seen multiple interpretations, and extended radicals).

The Japanese ministry of education released the [Jōyō kanji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C5%8Dy%C5%8D_kanji) which is the official kanji dictionary (writing, meaning, pronunciation).
This would be the base for our radicals.

> Japanese kanjis have both a chinese _"Onyomi"_ and japanese _"kunyomi"_ pronunciation.
